# Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)

This is the GitHub repo for the paper ["KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756). Find the documentation [here](https://kindxiaoming.github.io/pykan/). Here's [author's note](https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan?tab=readme-ov-file#authors-note) responding to the current hype of KANs.

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are promising alternatives of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). KANs have strong mathematical foundations just like MLPs: MLPs are based on the universal approximation theorem, while KANs are based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. KANs and MLPs are dual: KANs have activation functions on edges, while MLPs have activation functions on nodes. This simple change makes KANs better (sometimes much better!) than MLPs in terms of both model **accuracy** and **interpretability**. A quick intro of KANs [here](https://kindxiaoming.github.io/pykan/intro.html).

## Accuracy
**KANs have faster scaling than MLPs. KANs have better accuracy than MLPs with fewer parameters.**

**Example 1: fitting symbolic formulas**

## Interpretability
**KANs can be intuitively visualized. KANs offer interpretability and interactivity that MLPs cannot provide. We can use KANs to potentially discover new scientific laws.**

Pykan can be installed via PyPI or directly from GitHub. 

**Pre-requisites:**

```
Python 3.9.7 or higher
pip
```

**Installation via GitHub**

```
python -m venv pykan-env
source pykan-env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `pykan-env\Scripts\activate`
pip install git+https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan.git
```

Requirements

```python
# python==3.9.7
matplotlib==3.6.2
numpy==1.24.4
scikit_learn==1.1.3
setuptools==65.5.0
sympy==1.11.1
torch==2.2.2

```

**Optional: Conda Environment Setup**
For those who prefer using Conda:
```
conda create --name pykan-env python=3.9.7
conda activate pykan-env
pip install git+https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan.git  # For GitHub installation
# or
pip install pykan  # For PyPI installation
```

## Computation requirements

Examples in [tutorials](tutorials) are runnable on a single CPU typically less than 10 minutes. All examples in the paper are runnable on a single CPU in less than one day. Training KANs for PDE is the most expensive and may take hours to days on a single CPU. We use CPUs to train our models because we carried out parameter sweeps (both for MLPs and KANs) to obtain Pareto Frontiers. There are thousands of small models, which is why we use CPUs rather than GPUs. Admittedly, our problem scales are smaller than typical machine learning tasks but are typical for science-related tasks. If the scale of your task is large, it is advisable to use GPUs.

## Author's note
I would like to thank everyone interested in KANs. When I designed KANs and wrote the code, I had math & physics examples (which are quite a small scale!) in mind, so I did not consider many optimizations in efficiency or reusability. I'm honored to receive this unwarranted attention, which is way beyond my expectation. So, I accept any criticism from people complaining about the efficiency and reusability of the codes. My apology. My only hope is that you find `model.plot()` fun to play with :).

For users who are interested in scientific discoveries and scientific computing (the original users intended for), I'm happy to hear your applications and collaborate. This repo will remain mostly for this purpose, probably without significant updates on efficiency. In fact, there are already implementations like [efficientkan](https://github.com/Blealtan/efficient-kan) or [fouierkan](https://github.com/GistNoesis/FourierKAN/) that look promising for improving efficiency.

For machine learning-focused users, I have to be honest that KANs are likely not a simple plug-in that can be used out-of-the-box (yet). Hyperparameters need tuning, and more tricks special to your applications should be introduced. For example, [GraphKAN](https://github.com/WillHua127/GraphKAN-Graph-Kolmogorov-Arnold-Networks) suggests that KANs should better be used in latent space (need embedding and unembedding linear layers after inputs and before outputs). [KANRL](https://github.com/riiswa/kanrl) suggests that some trainable parameters should better be fixed in reinforcement learning to increase training stability.

The most common question I've been asked lately is whether KANs will be next-gen LLMs. I don't have good intuition about this. KANs are designed for applications where one cares about high accuracy and/or interpretability. We do care about LLM interpretability for sure, but interpretability can mean wildly different things for LLM and for science. Do we care about high accuracy for LLMs? I don't know; scaling laws seem to imply so, but probably not too high precision. Also, accuracy can mean different things for LLM and science. This subtlety makes it hard to directly transfer conclusions in our paper to LLMs or machine learning tasks in general. However, I would be very happy if you have enjoyed the high-level idea (learnable activation functions on edges or interacting with AI for scientific discoveries), which is not necessarily *the future*, but can hopefully inspire and impact *many possible futures*. As a physicist, the message I want to convey is less of "KANs are great" and more of "Try thinking of current architectures critically and seeking fundamentally different alternatives that can do fun and/or useful stuff".

I would like to welcome people to be critical of KANs, but also to be critical of critiques as well. Practice is the only criterion for testing understanding (实践是检验真理的唯一标准). We don't know many things beforehand until they are really tried and shown to succeed or fail. As much as I'm willing to see the success mode of KANs, I'm equally curious about the failure modes of KANs to understand the boundaries better. KANs and MLPs cannot replace each other (as far as I can tell); they each have advantages in some settings and limitations in others. I would be intrigued by a theoretical framework encompassing both and could even suggest new alternatives (physicists love unified theories, sorry :).)
